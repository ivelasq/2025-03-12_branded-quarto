## Abstract

Maintaining a consistent brand identity across data science outputs is essential for clear communication and a professional image. This talk introduces brand.yml, a powerful new tool designed to streamline adherence to organizational style guides within the Quarto publishing system. brand.yml simplifies the creation of visually consistent materials that perfectly align with your organization's brand guidelines in HTML reports, presentations, websites, and dashboards.

We'll explore how brand.yml allows you to define your brand's visual identity, including colors, fonts, logos, and more, in a single, centralized location.  You will learn how to integrate this configuration file into your Quarto projects, automatically applying the defined style guide to various outputs like reports, presentations, websites, and more. Beyond basic integration, Iâ€™ll share practical tips and demonstrate tools that simplify the process of designing and managing your brand.yml file to make brand customization even easier.

Join us to discover how brand.yml can elevate your Quarto documents to a new level of professionalism to ensure that your work is more impactful and on-brand.
